# 👋 Hello there! I'm Hugo Schroder (Hijack Dev)

💻 _Full Stack Developer | Passionate about clean code & CI/CD

## 🧭 About Me

I'm a full-stack web developer and UI designer passionate about building useful, scalable, and elegant digital products.  

I hold a Master's degree in Software Engineering for the Internet from the University of Artois, and I’ve spent two years working as an apprentice developer at CAF du Nord — where I contributed to modernizing internal tools, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and building responsive web apps with **Vue.js (Quasar)** and **Symfony**.

Today, I'm growing my **freelance activity** and creating **Hijack Dev**, a space where I share projects, ideas, and experiments around web development, UX, and innovation.  
My long-term goal: work independently, helping startups and teams turn their ideas into impactful products.

**What I love working on:**
- 🌐 Building responsive, user-friendly web apps  
- ⚙️ Implementing CI/CD workflows (GitLab CI)  
- 🧠 Designing clean, testable backend architectures (Symfony, Java, Node.js)  
- 🚀 Exploring DevOps, software architecture & product design  
- 💡 Experimenting with new tools, ideas, and ways of building better software
