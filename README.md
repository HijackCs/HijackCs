# 👋 Hello there! I'm Hugo Schroder (HijackCs)

💻 _Full Stack Developer (Vue.js / Symfony) | Passionate about clean code & CI/CD | Soon-to-be graduate_

## 🧭 About Me

I'm currently a full stack apprentice developer at **CAF du Nord**, working with Vue.js ([Quasar](https://quasar.dev/)) and Symfony. I focus on building maintainable, efficient internal tools and modern web apps.

I’m completing a Master’s degree in Software Engineering for the Internet at the **University of Artois**, and looking for a **full-time position starting September 2025**, while also growing my freelance activity, with the goal of eventually working independently.


Whether it's collaborating in a fast-paced team or taking full ownership of a project, I'm passionate about delivering robust and elegant solutions.

My interests include:
- Building responsive, user-friendly web apps
- Implementing CI/CD workflows (GitLab CI)
- Writing clean, testable backend code (Symfony, Java)
- Learning about DevOps & software architecture
