# 👋 Hi, I'm Hugo Schroder - Hijack Dev

💻 **Freelance Full-Stack Web Developer**  
I build **modern websites and internal tools** for small businesses and teams:  
fast to load, easy to maintain, and designed to convert users into clients.

## 🧭 What I Do

I'm a full-stack web developer helping startups, freelancers, and small teams build
reliable, scalable web applications and internal tools.

I hold a **Master’s degree in Software Engineering for the Internet**
from the University of Artois and spent the last 2 years as an apprentice developer
at **CAF du Nord**, where I worked on:
- Full-stack applications (Vue.js / Quasar + Symfony)
- CI/CD pipelines and automated deployments (GitLab CI)
- Modernization of internal tools and workflows

Today, I focus on my freelance activity under **Hijack Dev**, delivering clean,
maintainable solutions with a strong focus on usability and performance.
